## Overview

This project implements a Type 2 hypervisor for Linux-based `x86_64` systems using `QEMU (Quick Emulator)`. `QVM` is designed to facilitate the effecient use of QEMU which is a generic and open-source machine emulator and virtualizer that allows guest operating systems to run as an application on top of an existing operating system. Tkerhis implementation focuses on providing a user-friendly, efficient, and flexible virtualization solution for various guest operating systems.

## Features

- **Multiple OS Support**: Run various Linux-based guest operating systems, including Debian, ArchLinux, Kali Linux, Ubuntu, RaspiOS, and other specialized systems.
- **Lightweight & Effecient**: `QVM` is a sleek & efficient `Type 2 hypervisor` that leaves minimal footprint while maximising performance with seamless integration across platforms.
- **Hardware Emulation**: Emulate a wide range of hardware devices, including CPUs, network cards, and storage devices.
- **Disk Image Management**: Utilizes the `qcow2` format for efficient disk space usage and snapshot capabilities. `raw`, `vdi`, `vmdk` & `vhd` formats can also be used.
- **VM Templating**: Create and manage VM templates for quick and efficient replication of virtual machines.
- **Memory Management**: Configure and optimize VM memory usage with various backend options.
- **NUMA Support**: Enable `Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)` for improved performance in multi-processor systems.
- **KVM & VGA Support**: Enable `Kernel-based Virtual Machine` support and use KVM virtualization features to further enhance performance. `VGA` graphics display drivers can be used instead of default QEMU graphics drivers for specialised use-cases.

## Installation

**Note**: QVM has so far only been tested on Debian 12 & Kali Linux systems.


First, make sure that your system is up-to-date & that `git` is installed:

Using `apt`:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install git
```
Using `pacman`:
```
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S git
```
Using `dnf`:
```
dnf upgrade
dnf install git
```
Using `yum`:
```
sudo yum update && sudo yum upgrade
sudo yum install git
```
To install `QVM-Manager`, follow these steps:
```
cd /tmp/
git clone https://github.com/RoyalHighgrass/QVM-Manager.git
cd QVM-Manager
sudo chmod +x QVM/config.sh
sudo ./QVM/config.sh
```

## Requirements

All packages listed below (excluding `YAD`) are available via the Debian & Kali Linux repositories. This application is yet to be tested on the following commonly used Linux OS's;
`Ubuntu`, `ArchLinux`, `Manjaro`, `ParrotOS` & `RaspiOS`.
If you use one of these systems and any package listed below is not available via your systems repository, you may want to consider installing it manually from source before running the `sudo ./QVM/config.sh` command.

## Usage

Start QVM's CLI interface:
```
qvm-manager
```
Launch GUI interface:
```
qvm-manager --gui
```
Get version info:
```
qvm-manager --version
```
Show help message:
```
qvm-manager --help
```

For more advanced usage and configuration options, please refer to the [User Manual](QVM/User_Manual_-_QVM_Documentation) documentation.

## Configuration

The hypervisor VM specifications can easily be configured using command-line application interface, and templating can only be implemented via the QVM graphical user interface. Some key configuration areas include:

- Memory allocation
- CPU cores used
- Network interfaces
- Display drivers
- Audio interfaces
- KVM & VGA intergration
- Virtual hardware
- Storage devices
- Shared memory
- Host keyboard sharing
