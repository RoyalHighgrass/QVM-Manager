# QVM-Manager (QEMU Virtual Machine Manager)

# QVM Manager-1.0.3 Â© 2024 P.H.

## Overview

This project implements a Type 2 hypervisor using QEMU (Quick Emulator). QEMU is a generic and open-source machine emulator and virtualizer that runs as an application on top of an existing operating system. Our implementation focuses on providing a user-friendly, efficient, and flexible virtualization solution for various guest operating systems.

## Features

- **Multiple OS Support**: Run various guest operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and other specialized systems.
- **Hardware Emulation**: Emulate a wide range of hardware devices, including CPUs, network cards, and storage devices.
- **Disk Image Management**: Utilize the `qcow2` format for efficient disk space usage and snapshot capabilities.
- **VM Templating**: Create and manage VM templates for quick and efficient replication of virtual machines.
- **Memory Management**: Configure and optimize VM memory usage with various backend options.
- **NUMA Support**: Enable Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) for improved performance in multi-processor systems.
