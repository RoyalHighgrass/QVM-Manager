# QVM-Manager (QEMU Virtual Machine Manager)

# QVM Manager-1.0.3 Â© 2024 P.H.

## Overview

This project implements a Type 2 hypervisor for Linux-based systems using `QEMU (Quick Emulator)`. `QVM` is designed to facilitate the effecient use of QEMU which is a generic and open-source machine emulator and virtualizer that allows guest operating systems to run as an application on top of an existing operating system. This implementation focuses on providing a user-friendly, efficient, and flexible virtualization solution for various guest operating systems.

## Features

- **Multiple OS Support**: Run various Linux-based guest operating systems, including Debian, ArchLinux, Kali Linux, Ubuntu, RaspiOS, and other specialized systems.
- **Hardware Emulation**: Emulate a wide range of hardware devices, including CPUs, network cards, and storage devices.
- **Disk Image Management**: Utilizes the `qcow2` format for efficient disk space usage and snapshot capabilities. `raw`, `vdi`, `vmdk` & `vhd` formats can also be used.
- **VM Templating**: Create and manage VM templates for quick and efficient replication of virtual machines.
- **Memory Management**: Configure and optimize VM memory usage with various backend options.
- **NUMA Support**: Enable `Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)` for improved performance in multi-processor systems.
- **KVM & VGA Support**: Enable `Kernel Virtual Machine` support and use KVM virtualization features to further enhance performance. `VGA` graphics display drivers can be used instead of default QEMU graphics drivers for specialised use-cases.

## Installation

To install the QVM-Manager via a linux terminal, follow these steps:

```
cd /tmp/
git clone https://github.com/RoyalHighgrass/QVM-Manager.git
cd QVM-Manager
sudo chmod +x QVM/config.sh
sudo ./QVM/config.sh
```
Check that `git` is installed and/or `update` your system if you get any errors.

## Usage

Start QVM Manager:
```
qvm-manager
```
Launch GUI interface:
```
qvm-manager --gui
```
Get version info:
```
qvm-manager --version
```
Show help message:
```
qvm-manager --help
```

For more advanced usage and configuration options, please refer to the documentation.

## Configuration
