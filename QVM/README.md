QVM Manager-1.0.3

# QEMU Type 2 Hypervisor Project

## Overview

This project implements a Type 2 hypervisor using QEMU (Quick Emulator). QEMU is a generic and open-source machine emulator and virtualizer that runs as an application on top of an existing operating system[2][8]. Our implementation focuses on providing a user-friendly, efficient, and flexible virtualization solution for various guest operating systems.

## Features

- **Multiple OS Support**: Run various guest operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and other specialized systems[8].
- **Hardware Emulation**: Emulate a wide range of hardware devices, including CPUs, network cards, and storage devices[2].
- **Disk Image Management**: Utilize the `qcow2` format for efficient disk space usage and snapshot capabilities[2].
- **VM Templating**: Create and manage VM templates for quick and efficient replication of virtual machines[1].
- **Memory Management**: Configure and optimize VM memory usage with various backend options[4].
- **NUMA Support**: Enable Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) for improved performance in multi-processor systems[4].

## Installation
